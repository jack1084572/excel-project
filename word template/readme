 Shape Drawing Steps:
1. Rounded Rectangle Frame

Go to Insert â†’ Shapes â†’ Rectangle

Select the rectangle, then you will see a yellow adjustment handle (the small yellow circle)

Drag the yellow handle to adjust the corner radius â†’ it becomes a rounded rectangle

2. Rounded Bar Rectangle

Go to Insert â†’ Shapes â†’ Rectangle

Stretch the rectangle horizontally to make a bar shape

Use the yellow adjustment handle to drag left or right â†’ adjust the roundness at both ends (commonly used for progress bars or labels)

3. Timeline (Arrowed Line)

Go to Insert â†’ Shapes â†’ Lines â†’ Straight Line

Draw a horizontal line on the slide (hold Shift to keep it perfectly horizontal/vertical)

Select the line â†’ Go to Shape Format â†’ Shape Outline â†’ Arrows

Choose Begin Arrow or End Arrow â†’ to create a timeline effect

ðŸ’¡ Tips:

To mark multiple timeline nodes, insert small circles or rectangles evenly along the line.

Combine the rounded bar (progress bar) with the timeline for better visualization.
